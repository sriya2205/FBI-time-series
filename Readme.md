This project involves time series forecasting of crime-related data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) dataset. The goal was to analyze past trends and build a forecasting model to predict future values for better insight into crime data trends and aid in data-driven decision-making.

*** Project Overview:

.Objective: Forecast the number of criminal incidents based on historical FBI crime data using statistical and machine learning models.

.Dataset Source: FBI Crime Statistics (Cleaned & processed for modeling)

***Scope:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Time series decomposition

* Model development & evaluation

* Forecasting and visualization

*** Technologies Used:

1. Python

2. Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

3. Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

4. Statsmodels, pmdarima, Prophet, Sklearn – Time series forecasting and evaluation

***Methodology:

* Data Preprocessing:

1. Handled missing values

2. Converted date columns to datetime format

3. Resampled the data for appropriate granularity (monthly/yearly)

***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. Crime trend visualization

2. Seasonality and stationarity checks

***Time Series Modeling:

1. ARIMA/SARIMA

2. Prophet (Facebook)

3. Auto ARIMA

***Model comparison using RMSE/MAPE:

* Forecasting:

1. Forecasted future crime counts

2. Visualized predictions vs actuals

*** Results:

1. The selected models showed promising accuracy on test data.

2. ARIMA and Prophet performed well in capturing seasonal patterns and overall trends.

3. Future forecasts help understand crime growth/decline patterns over time.
